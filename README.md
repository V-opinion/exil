During a war or a threat of war, the UN agenda regarding the environmental goal is forgotten.

Democracy reconstruction

Despite the fact that Sweden has several democracy ministers, the IDEA International Institute for Democracy at Str√∂msborg in Stockholm and the Democracy Building, democracy has not developed. Low turnout despite the fact that Sweden has many with an immigrant background who have fled from dictators and sought protection, among other things here and are hungry to exercise their democratic rights.
Freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of thought and freedom of expression come before democracy or democracy comes before freedom or the exercise of both at the same time.
Can democracy, which already has loose foundations, be developed in a world governed by unsustainable democracy and unsustainable politics?
1) People who have the right to vote but with low turnout
2) Democracy not developed within the EU.
3) UN General Assembly which is a mixture of weak democracies and non-democracies
4) People in the dictatorial countries who do not care about democracy or do not dare to speak out about democracy. Some who have managed to escape from dictators and received protection and the right to vote but who still do not go to the polls. Others do not believe in democracy on the grounds that it is the United States that, after all, rules the world, not the UN or the EU.
5) The Christian-Jewish countries provide support to Israel and the Islamic countries provide support to Palestine,
6) Countries with a huge population of over one billion and with a large area and countries that fight for their land an area to which they are entitled, for example the United Kingdom rules the Falkland Islands and Denmark rules Greenland. Conflicts, wars, pandemics, unemployment, poverty and environmental degradation.

The receipt of information, associate and analyze and then draw the conclusion, that which leads to the above six discrepancies. These deviations require a redefinition of democracy, to agree on what criteria a country must meet in order to be considered democratic. How many% of the eligible residents participate in the election during five terms. Which democratic constitutions are responsible for the democratic development in a country. How far has democracy developed in the respective countries. How democracy is defined and described in their constitutions.

Thus, a continuous reassessment of Democracy Reconstruction and its application leads to a democratic development.
Democracy reconstruction
The strong reason is that democracy has been wrongly applied not only in your party that you support or vote for but throughout the world, the EU and the UN, that the application is against the principle that it is democracy that has given all faiths religious freedom.
Since it is democracy that has given all denominations religious freedom, it is therefore important that democracy encompasses and is applied by all denominations without exception
The alternative is to remove all religions because religious communities oppose the application of democracy and have also not contributed to democratic development. Religious conflicts continue and it is more difficult to find solutions.

If democracy is to be introduced in all denominations without exception and religious freedom is preserved, it requires an election similar to the church election that is applied in some countries. Having choices in every denomination is not very practical and also costly.
Therefore, a transition from the church election to a multi-religion election system in the countries that already have church elections and direct application of a multi-religion election system in other countries that do not have church elections is more appropriate and with the multi-religion support corresponding to party support, it becomes a cost-effective solution.

Namely, societies have many complex religious problems that cannot be solved by religious communities using only the benefits that religious freedom entails without the need for reform.
The environmental model for democracy, democracy from theory to practice with a multi-religion electoral system as a basis.

War is a threat to the environment and to humanity
